# 09 — Trust Rules

> ## ⚠ STRUCK SIGNATURES — read this before building anything from this file
>
> A founder audit on **2026-08-13** checked this handoff's "five spatial signatures"
> against the shipped code. Two were never built and have been struck; two were
> narrowed. This file predates that audit and, except where corrected inline below,
> still describes the struck versions as required.
>
> **`CLAUDE.md` §2 in the repo root is the authority. This file is not.**
>
> - **Edge rails** (4px blue-left / green-right, `<EdgeRails>`) — **STRUCK.** Never
>   built. No `EdgeRails.tsx` exists in `src/`; the `.rail*` CSS and the
>   `rail` / `rail-buyer` / `rail-supplier` / `z-rails` tokens had zero consumers and
>   were deleted. Buyer→supplier orientation is carried by **panel order** on the
>   review screen and a labelled **`Buyer → Supplier`** column in the queue.
> - **Canonical Spine review** (`<CanonicalSpine>` / `<SpineNode>`) — **DELETED.**
>   Zero importers. The shipped review at `/inbox/[orderId]` is `OrderWorkshop` →
>   `MapperWorkbench`: *What we received* | *What we'll send* | *Live preview*.
> - **Wire Topology** — kept, but **demoted** from dashboard hero to a "System map" tab.
> - **Document Anatomy** — kept, **narrowed**: the document pane ships; the per-zone
>   confidence overlay does not.
> - **Cross-section card edge** (`<XCard>`) and the buyer-blue / supplier-green
>   colour semantics — **kept, unchanged.**
> - The **220px navy sidebar** is not desktop chrome: desktop nav moved to the topbar
>   and the sidebar renders only in the mobile drawer.

These are not principles. They are **non-negotiable product rules**. Every screen is designed against them.

## Rule 1 · Provenance everywhere

Every AI suggestion, auto-mapping, or auto-corrected field shows three things:

1. **Confidence** — as a percentage, in mono, with threshold color.
2. **Source attribution** — what evidence supports the suggestion. *"AI · 84% — used 6× by Heinrich in last 90d"*
3. **One-click jump** — to the matching source-document anatomy zone, with the relevant text highlighted.

**Implementation:**
- Every extracted field shows a confidence chip and the source field path (`← header`, `← parties.billTo`).
- Every AI suggestion has a "Jump to field" action that scrolls to and highlights the matching field on the review screen.
- Every mapping shows its source: `Manual / AI / Imported / Inherited from supplier rule`.

> **Struck 2026-08-13 — targets only; the rule stands.** These three bullets used to say "spine node"
> and "highlights both the spine node and the source anatomy zone". `CanonicalSpine.tsx` was deleted
> (zero importers), so there is no spine node to highlight, and the per-zone anatomy overlay was never
> built, so there is no zone to jump to. **Provenance itself is not struck** — confidence, source
> attribution and jump-to-field are still required; they now target the mapped-field rows in
> `MapperWorkbench` and the document view in `src/components/bridge/document/`.

**Anti-pattern:**
- A green checkmark with no number. (A "looks good" with no provenance is worse than no validation at all — operators stop trusting both.)

## Rule 2 · No silent automation

Auto-process — the mode where an order skips human review when validation passes — is:

- **Off by default** for every new supplier.
- **Per-supplier**, never global.
- **Explicitly turned on** via a settings page with a confirmation step that lists what the supplier requires.
- **Visible** in the supplier header as a status pill: *"Auto-process: ON"* or *"Auto-process: OFF — every order reviewed"*.
- **Audited** — every auto-processed order has a delivery-log entry tagged `auto-processed` with the rules that passed.

The Upload Workbench shows the current auto-process state for the chosen supplier in an amber pill if it's enabled, so the operator knows their file may go through without review.

**Anti-pattern:**
- A subtle "auto" toggle hidden in workspace settings that applies to everything. Operators must surface the toggle on the screen where it bites.

## Rule 3 · Failure is loud, recoverable, and explained

The **Failed** view is the most useful screen in the product. Not a tombstone.

Every failed order shows:

1. **What the supplier said** — the literal error message, or the rejection from the ERP, or the parse error. Raw, in mono.
2. **What we sent** — the exact output file we delivered (cXML, CSV, etc.), with a "View output" button that opens the side-by-side diff against the canonical model.
3. **What we'd retry** — if the failure is recoverable (e.g. a transient SFTP timeout), a primary "Retry" button. If recoverable with a fix (e.g. "quantity must be > 0"), a primary "Fix and resend" button that opens the order review pre-scrolled to the failing field.
4. **What this means for similar orders** — if 3+ orders failed with the same rule, surface a banner: "5 orders have failed with this rule today. Adjust the validation?"

**Anti-pattern:**
- "Something went wrong." with a help link.
- A red banner with no action.
- Hiding the supplier's response text.

## Rule 4 (implicit) · The source is sacred

The user can never get into a state where they can't see what the supplier or buyer originally sent. **The order review screen always shows the source document on the left**, even if the operator has heavily edited the fields to its right. The original file is always one click away.

The source is a **primary column, not a side panel**. Never a modal, never a wizard step that replaces it.

In shipped code the left pane is **"What we received"** (`IncomingPane`, blue `#1E66C9` dot) inside `MapperWorkbench`, rendering the document view from `src/components/bridge/document/`.

> **Struck 2026-08-13 — naming only; the rule itself stands.** This rule used to be phrased as "The
> Canonical Spine Review always shows the source on the left … implicit in the `<DocumentAnatomy>`
> component." Both of those names were struck: `CanonicalSpine.tsx` was deleted with zero importers,
> and `<DocumentAnatomy>`'s per-zone confidence overlay was never built (the document pane itself
> ships). **What was struck is the 3-column-spine form and the component names — not the
> requirement.** Source-visible-on-the-left is real, load-bearing, and still enforced on the shipped
> review screen. Do not read the strike as permission to hide the source.

## Rule 5 (implicit) · Edits are auditable

Every operator edit to a canonical field is:
- Saved as a draft within 2 seconds.
- Logged in the delivery log with the diff: `payment_terms: "Net 30" → "Net 45" by Maria K. at 14:32`.
- Visible in the Order History tab (right-side drawer) as an inline diff.

The operator never has to ask "did my edit save?" or "what did I change?".

## Trust scorecard

Before shipping any new screen, the designer answers these five questions:

1. Can the operator see where a value came from? (Provenance)
2. Can the operator see what would happen automatically? (No silent auto)
3. Can the operator recover from this screen if something failed? (Loud failure)
4. Can the operator see the original file? (Source is sacred)
5. Can the operator see what they (and anyone else) changed? (Audit)

If any answer is "no," the screen isn't ready.

## Friday 4:30pm test

Read the screen and ask: *"Would a 40-year-old order-processing operator at a Baltic distributor trust this with a €71k cXML order at 4:30pm on a Friday?"*

If they would hesitate, the design hasn't earned the trust yet. The five rules above are how we earn it.
